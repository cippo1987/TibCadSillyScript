TibCadSillyScript
=================

A simple bash + awk script to submit TiberCAD jobs
This is a simple, not optimized bash script to run TiberCAD with different parameters.
It is possible to change parameters both in the .tib calculation configuration file and in the material .dat file.
It is useful to scan different values of physic quantities such as electronic mass.
The same results could be achieved also using proprietary software such as MathLab.
